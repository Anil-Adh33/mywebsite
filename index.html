	<pr title="About Oxford University"><b>The University of <a href="Oxford.html">Oxford</a> is a collegiate research university in Oxford, England</b>.
	There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world 
	and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation after the University of Bologna.
	It grew rapidly from 1167 when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris.
    After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge 
	where they established what became the University of Cambridge.<br>
    The two 'ancient universities' are frequently jointly called 'Oxbridge'.<em>The history and influence of the University of Oxford has made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.</em></pr><br>
